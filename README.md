# Emergent-Tape
A multi-agent simulation where a swarm of turing like machines collaboratively manipulate a shared 1D data array called the "tape". 
Each machine uses a randomly generated program tree structure to make local decisions, compute predictions, and update tape values via Bayesian inference.

Inspired by concepts from neural networks, 
Turing machines, and distributed systems, 
the simulation aims to explore emergent patterns and collective intelligence.
